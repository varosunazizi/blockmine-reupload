<h2>BLOCKMINE ðŸ’–</h2>

ðŸ“¢ Blockmine is a project developed for the Minetest, its adding more details, content and fun for the game.
We stopped developing it in 2020 (It hasn't received enough attention.)
Blockmine uses an old version of Minetest released 2 years ago.

<br>

ðŸ“¢ Current version of Blockmine: 0.2.1 beta (last update)
